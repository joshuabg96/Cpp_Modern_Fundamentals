/*
Passing a Pointer to a Function
Problem Statement:

Pointers are a fundamental aspect of C++. They allow for flexible and efficient programming by giving direct access to memory. You are tasked with writing a function that uses a pointer to multiply an integer value.

Write a function:

void multiply_with_pointer(int* ptr, int multiplier);


Input:

A pointer to an integer (int* ptr). This integer will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.

An integer (int multiplier) which is the multiplier. This integer will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.

Output:

The function should multiply the integer at the memory address that ptr points to by multiplier.



Function signature:

void multiply_with_pointer(int* ptr, int multiplier);


Constraints:

All the values are strictly positive and within the integer range specified.
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void multiply_with_pointer(int* ptr, int multiplier);

void multiply_with_pointer(int* ptr, int multiplier)
{
    *ptr *= multiplier;
}

int main()
{
    int* ptr {nullptr};
    int mult {0};

    mult = 10;
    int res = 5;

    ptr = &res;
    multiply_with_pointer(ptr, mult);
    cout << res << endl;
    return 0;
}
